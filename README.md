## üìù How to Register on Reqres.in

Since reqres.in is a fake API, it provides a fixed set of users for authentication. The API does not store new users, so registration will always return a static response.

- Registering a User

Make a POST request to <https://reqres.in/api/register> with the following payload:

```bash
{
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "pistol"
}
```

- Logging In

Make a POST request to <https://reqres.in/api/login> with the same credentials:

```bash
{
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "cityslicka"
}
```

Use this token to authenticate requests for profile and transactions.
